Needs to be able to:
Display/save off the current animation frame data for a certain animation
Edit the translation/rotation values on the fly
	Make new buttons/keybinds for editing animation
		Add/subtract from a certain value
		Toggle between rotation/translation? Look at animation format agian
Be able to reload the animation on the fly or with some kind of "refresh"
If saving off, will need the app to look to the new animation location instead of in the ROM
If directly editing the rom, will need to inject the new data or just use that as the save point

Go into "edit mode". In that state:
	Prevent changing animation
		Done
	Put current animation into a new array/vector that can be used to edit/load from
		Done
	Give different controls for switching bone, updating translation/rotation
	Save the text file when exiting edit mode
		Done - had to change to unsigned short may be an issue later REMEMBER

For din's fire:
Program says offset is 0x0713e840
52 frames
Can we output the frame data?

Link animation format:

-XYZ Translation-

Just three signed 16-bit values. XX XX YY YY ZZ ZZ.

XX being the X translation, YY being the Y translation, ZZ being the Z translation. These are relative to Link's current position on a map. When the animation is done playing, he will return to his original position.

-Limb rotations-

Three unsigned 16-bit values for each limb. XX XX YY YY ZZ ZZ.

XX being the X rotation, YY being the Y rotation, ZZ being the Z rotation. Link has 0x15 limbs, so this section is 0x7E bytes long (0x15 * 6).

Format (provided by Flotonic; offsets are relative to the start of each frame):
0x6 = Link's entire rotation.
0xC = Waist
0x12 = Waist (but doesn't rotate the waist Display List)
0x18 = Right Thigh
0x1E = Right Shin
0x24 = Right Foot
0x2A = Left Thigh
0x30 = Left Shin
0x36 = Left Foot
0x3C = Torso
0x42 = Head
0x48 = Hat
0x4E = Shirt Collar
0x54 = Left Shoulder
0x5A = Left Forearm
0x60 = Left Hand
0x66 = Right Shoulder
0x6C = Right Forearm
0x72 = Right Hand
0x78 = Items on Back (Sheath and Shield)
0x7E = Shirt Collar (again)

-Facial Behavior-

Two bytes.

00 PP

PP = Property. This changes the appearance of Link's eyes.
