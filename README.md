Ancient things, mostly in C, all jumbled together & probably not really worth looking at. All unsupported, some of it may not even compile anymore, I dunno...

## Things In Here
**azunyan8**: Chip-8 interpreter, SDL, Win32 & Wii; the part where it ran on my Wii was kinda cool at the time...

**badrdp**: N64 graphics Ucode interpreter and renderer library thingy; not complete, a bit buggy

**dlviewer**: N64 graphics display list viewer using badrdp & misaka; limited but works well enough, I guess

**misaka**: Text user interface & console input library using curses; was also nice to have at the time

**ozmav2**: N64 Zelda map viewer and editor, uses badrdp & misaka; the first one I made that got it kinda right

**sf64toolkit**: Star Fox 64 file handling & level viewing tool, misaka again, but no badrdp this time; old, broken, buggy...

**sm64toz64**: Super Mario 64 to Zelda 64 level converter, see its readme for more details

**zsaten**: N64 Zelda actor and animation viewer, again badrdp and misaka; felt amazing back in the day, now it's meh
